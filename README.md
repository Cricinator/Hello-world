# Hello-world
This is my first repository.

Hi, my name is Eric Glass.  I am a recent graduate from Liberty University in IT.  I find programming to be fun and challenging, much like a puzzle.  When I create a program that runs perfectly, I feel that I have really accomplished something great, while it might have been small every little bit of practice helps further my journey to becoming a better programmer.
