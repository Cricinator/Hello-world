# Hello-world
This is my first repository.

Hi, my name is Eric.  I am a beginner programmer and a Senior at Liberty University.  I graduate next year (May 2017) with a degree in IT.  I find programming to be fun and challenging, much like a puzzle.  When I create a program that runs perfectly, I feel that I have really accomplished something great, while it might have been small every little bit of practice helps further my journey to becoming a good programmer.
